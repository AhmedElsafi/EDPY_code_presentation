### Supervised Learning Code Presentation - DT Regression & Nested Cross-Validation

This project used Decision Tree Regressor to predict life expectancy using WHO data. A copy of the dataset can be found in this repo ('Life Expectancy Data.csv'). Full description of the data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who.

Nested cross-validation was employed for hyperparameter tuning (inner loop, k=3) and model evaluation (outer loop, k=5).
